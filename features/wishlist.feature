  As a student
  I want to prepare a wishlist for the upcoming semester

  Scenario: Wishlist classes with overlapping times
    Given I have logged in as a "student"
    And I am working with the "next" semester
    When I search for "csc2"
    And I wishlist these classes:
      | Subject | Number | Name                                           | Instructor      | Times               |
      | CSC     | 216    | Programming Concepts - Java                    | Jayne Cobb      | TH 09:00AM-10:30AM  |
      | CSC     | 226    | Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists   | Malcom Reynolds | TH 08:00AM-09:15AM  |
    Then my wishlist should have these classes:
      | Subject | Number | Name                                           | Instructor      | Times               |

      | CSC     | 226    | Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists   | Malcom Reynolds | TH 08:00AM-09:15AM  |

  Scenario: Conflicts are noted
    Given I have logged in as a "student"
    And I am working with the "current" semester
    And my wishlist has these classes:
      | Subject | Number | Name                                           | Instructor      | Times               |

      | CSC     | 226    | Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists   | Malcom Reynolds | TH 08:00AM-09:15AM  |
    Then show me the page
    When I navigate to the "Wishlist" page
    Then there should be a highlight on these classes:

      | CSC     | 226    | Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists   | Malcom Reynolds | TH 08:00AM-09:15AM  |
    And I should see a caption that contains "conflict"
