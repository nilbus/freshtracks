= FreshTracks

A limited functionality, single-user prototype that demonstrates usability improvements for the NCSU course registration system.

Live demo available at http://freshtracks.heroku.com . Try logging in with username "student@ncsu.edu" and a password of "password".  

== Problems We Solve

- Too many clicks/pageloads to accomplish anything - adding each class requires navigating through 6 pages
- Separate Wishlist and Shopping Cart is unnecessary and confusing
- Degree requirements, which determine what classes you want to register for, are not accessible through the course registration system

== Design Philosophy

- Build around the most common use cases; use a goal-centric design rather than designing around data structures
- Make information quickly accessible through expanding lists that don't require additional network access
- Details that are less important should be hidden yet easily accessible
- Actions should provide visual cues to give the user an understanding of what they are doing
